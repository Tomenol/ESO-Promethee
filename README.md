# ESO-Promethee

Development of the realtime Navigation system of the Prometheus experimental rocket to be tested during CNES' 2022 C'Space launch campain in France. This system is based on an Extended Kalman Filter sensor fusion algorithm to compute an optimal state estimate of the rocket.
This repository contains all the files and documents used during the development of the navigation module.
